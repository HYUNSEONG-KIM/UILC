## ABSTRACT


## INTRODUCTION


## FORMULAS AND EQUATIONS

### Optical model of LED

 imperpect Lambertian or generalied Lambertian model, this model is commonly used for hemisphere lenz LED device and far field irradation.
$$I(r,\theta) = \frac{I_0}{r^2} \cos^m(\theta)$$

$$I(x,t) = \frac{I_0 H^m}{(H^2 + (t-x)^2)^{\frac{m}{2}+1}}$$

### Assumption 

### Seperation of Area

The illuminous distribtuion of center and boundary point $t= 0, W/2$ induced by one pair of LEDs with distance $x$ from origin can be expressed as function $I_c(x), I_b(x)$.

$$I_c (x) := \\I_b(x) := $$

The difference function of such two distributions is defined as $$\text{Di}(x) := (I_b - I_c )(x)$$

If width of LED device $w$ is given, the domain is $[w/2 , W/2]$, because for $x < w/2$, the two LEDs are overlaped each other and it is physically impossible.  

### Linear - Even LEDs

### Linear - Odd LEDs

Since, the total LEDs are located symmetric for z-axis at origin, if the number of LEDs is odd, then the one LED consequnetly exists at $x=0$ point. 

### A region LEDs

### Rectangular 
The rectangular array can be acheived vertical overlapping of two linear array. Even though, their irradiation distribution of 1 linear LED array by vertical line for LED array is different for single LED, conserving $m$ value is vaild. As $m$ value increases, their vertical irradiation distribution will be remain same shape with single LED
