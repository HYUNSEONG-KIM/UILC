Simple approximate equations and formulas are derived for the optimum LED-to-LED spacing, i.e., the optimum packaging density, of several array configurations to achieve uniform near-field irradiance.},

abstract = {A resolution criterion due to Sparrow is studied. Unlike the well-known Rayleigh resolution criterion, the Sparrow resolution criterion is dependent upon the coherence properties of the incident light. The extreme limits of complete coherence and complete incoherence are investigated. An apodization scheme for increasing the coherent Sparrow resolution limit is formulated via the calculus of variations. The determination of the required pupil function (amplitude distribution over the exit pupil) necessitates the solution of an inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equation. Both slit and circular aperture are studied in detail.},

abstract = {We propose a numerical optimization method designing LED array for achieving a good uniform illumination distribution on target plane. Simulated annealing algorithm is employed to optimize LED array arrangement. Using the method, we optimized three LED arrays with various luminous intensity profiles. In order to exhibit the design freedom of the method, we use some LEDs with different intensity value in the first and third array, respectively. By optimizing, the three arrays all produced highly uniform illumination distribution with the uniformity of 0.12, 0.23 and 0.13, respectively. It indicates our method can design various luminous intensity distribution LED arrays and design array consisting of LEDs with different intensity value. In addition, the method is simple and can optimize the LED array automatically by computer program. To the best of our knowledge, it is first time to use numerical optimization method to design the optimal LED array arrangement for uniform irradiance.},

abstract = {We propose a numerical optimization method based on local search algorithm to design an LED array for a highly uniform illumination distribution. In the first place, an initial LED array is randomly generated and the corresponding value of the objective function is calculated. In the second place, the value of the objective function is iteratively improved by applying local changes of the LED array until the objective function value can not be improved. This method can automatically design an array of LEDs with different luminous intensity value and distribution. Computer simulations show that the near-optimal LED array with highly uniform illumination distribution on target plane is obtained by this method.},
