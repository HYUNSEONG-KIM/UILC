## Description of routines


---
This functions 



---
This routines are based on "". Actually, it is written for such paper. This routines are calculates boundary propagation with fit boundary intensity to center point. This routines can be combined with multiple solutions not only analytical methods(e.g Sparrow's criterion) but also various stochastic methods.
